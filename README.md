# Unconstrained-optimization---Boccaccio-Gaza-Monco
The files for the unconstrained optimization assignment are divided into the **5 problems/functions** and the **3 numerical methods** used to solve them. 
- Each **function** has inside the Matlab file "*.mlx*" where they are solved with the 3 methods and the files "*.m*" where may be defined the functions or their gradient.
- In "**Numerical methods**" there is the steepest descent method, the inexact Newton method, and the modified Newton method both in the version "base" and in the version "plot", to plot the contour plot and the surf plot for the 3D functions. Furthermore, there are other 4 files that contain the forcing terms and the finite difference approximating functions used in the 2 Newton methods.
